            <h2>Foreword</h2>
            <p>I want to use JS for interactivity, and progressive enhancement.
                In this page, we have a nav element for navigation, where
                the current section is highlighted using JS. </p>
            <p>The page layout uses CSS grid. Since we're using CSS Grid to lay
                out the children of <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, adding
                <code>align-self: start;</code> to <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> 
                    is an important one here. If we would omit it, the
                nav element would be as high as the enclosing main element.
                If that were the case, then nav would never be able to
                stick.
            </p>
            <p>The code in this page is adapted from <a

                <p>I've also used David Millington's website as a reference for the
                    fonts on this page. His <a href="https://daveon.design/introducing-fontimize-subset-fonts-to-exactly-and-only-your-websites-used-characters.html">
                    Fontimize</a> python package is very useful and I've used it
                    to make a subset font reducing the font files from about 1mB to
                    about 28 kB.

        <section id="Grid">
            <h2>Grid</h2>
            <p>Css grid is used for laying elements in a grid. </p>
            <p>CSS Grid
                Layout excels at dividing a page into major regions or
                defining the relationship in terms of size, position, and
                layer, between parts of a control built from HTML
                primitives. </p>
            <p>Like tables, grid layout enables an
                author to align elements into columns and rows. However,
                many more layouts are either possible or easier with CSS
                grid than they were with tables. For example, a grid
                container's child elements could position themselves so
                they actually overlap and layer, similar to CSS positioned
                elements. </p>
            <h3>What is a grid? </h3>
            <p>A grid is a set
                of intersecting horizontal and vertical lines defining
                columns and rows. Elements can be placed onto the grid
                within these column and row lines. CSS grid layout has the
                following features: Fixed and flexible track sizes </p>
            <p>You can create a grid with fixed track sizes â€“ using pixels
                for example. This sets the grid to the specified pixel
                which fits to the layout you desire. You can also create a
                grid using flexible sizes with percentages or with the fr
                unit designed for this purpose. </p>
            <h3>Item placement
            </h3>
            <p>You can place items into a precise location on the
                grid using line numbers, names or by targeting an area of
                the grid. Grid also contains an algorithm to control the
                placement of items not given an explicit position on the
                grid. </p>
            <h3>Creation of additional tracks to hold
                content </h3>
            <p>You can define an explicit grid with grid
                layout. The Grid Layout specification is flexible enough to
                add additional rows and columns when needed. Features such
                as adding <q>as many columns that will fit into a container</q>
                are included. </p>
            <h3>Alignment control </h3>
            <p>Grid
                contains alignment features so we can control how the items
                align once placed into a grid area, and how the entire grid
                is aligned. </p>
            <h3>Control of overlapping content </h3>
            <p>More than one item can be placed into a grid cell or area
                and they can partially overlap each other. This layering
                may then be controlled with the z-index property. </p>

        <section id="Intersection-Observer-Api">
            <h2>Intersection Observer
                API</h2>
            <p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API">Intersection
                    Observer Api</a> is a web API which provides a way to
                asynchronously observe changes in the intersection of a
                target element with an ancestor element or with a top-level
                document's viewport. </p>
            <p>Historically, detecting
                visibility of an element, or the relative visibility of two
                elements in relation to each other, has been a difficult
                task for which solutions have been unreliable and prone to
                causing the browser and the sites the user is accessing to
                become sluggish. As the web has matured, the need for this
                kind of information has grown. Intersection information is
                needed for many reasons, such as: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lazy-loading of images or other content as a page is
                    scrolled. </li>
                <li>Implementing <q>infinite scrolling</q>
                    web sites, where more and more content is loaded and
                    rendered as you scroll, so that the user doesn't have
                    to flip through pages. </li>
                <li>Reporting of
                    visibility of advertisements in order to calculate ad
                    revenues. </li>
                <li>Deciding whether or not to perform
                    tasks or animation processes based on whether or not
                    the user will see the result. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Implementing intersection detection in the past involved
                event handlers and loops calling methods like
                Element.getBoundingClientRect() to build up the needed
                information for every element affected. Since all this code
                runs on the main thread, even one of these can cause
                performance problems. When a site is loaded with these
                tests, things can get downright ugly. </p>
            <p>Consider a
                web page that uses infinite scrolling. It uses a
                vendor-provided library to manage the advertisements placed
                periodically throughout the page, has animated graphics
                here and there, and uses a custom library that draws
                notification boxes and the like. Each of these has its own
                intersection detection routines, all running on the main
                thread. The author of the web site may not even realize
                this is happening, since they may know very little about
                the inner workings of the two libraries they are using. As
                the user scrolls the page, these intersection detection
                routines are firing constantly during the scroll handling
                code, resulting in an experience that leaves the user
                frustrated with the browser, the web site, and their
                computer. </p>
            <p>The Intersection Observer API lets code
                register a callback function that is executed whenever an
                element they wish to monitor enters or exits another
                element (or the viewport), or when the amount by which the
                two intersect changes by a requested amount. This way,
                sites no longer need to do anything on the main thread to
                watch for this kind of element intersection, and the
                browser is free to optimize the management of intersections
                as it sees fit. </p>
            <p>One thing the Intersection Observer
                API can't tell you: the exact number of pixels that overlap
                or specifically which ones they are; however, it covers the
                much more common use case of <q>If they intersect by somewhere
                around N%, I need to do something.</q> </p>
