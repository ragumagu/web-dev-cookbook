        You use CSS for styling a web page.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can see how a tiny amount of CSS greatly improves the document, by
        toggling CSS off in developer tools.
    </p>

    <p>
        CSS can be included in a page using the style tag, or using external
        style sheets. It can also be inline with the html, but don't do that,
        it will make your code messy.
    </p>

    <h2>Centering content</h2>

    <p>
        In this page, I want the main heading (h1) and image to be centered with
        the page, and sub heading (h2) to be left aligned with the rest of
        the other paragraphs.
    </p>

    <p>
        To do this, I set display mode flex for html, flex-direction to column,
        and align-items center. This centers the body, and puts all the
        content at the start (left) of the body.
    </p>

    <p>
        Then, I set the display mode flex for body, flex-direction to column,
        and align-self to center for h1, img and p tags.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <code>align-items: center</code> rule aligns the items such that
        they align perfectly to the center of the cross axis of the flex
        container, in turn squishing all the elements inside it to their
        default/set width.
        Without setting <code>align-items: center</code>, the body would not
        be squished to the center (body will span entire page), making the
        sub-heading appear at the left of the page (and not left of body).
    </p>

    <p>
        Setting max-width on the flex items to 80ch wraps the long lines to 80
        characters per line and keeps the content readable.
    </p>

    <h2>Line heights</h2>
    <p>
        Setting line-height to 1.6 lets the text breathe, and headings must be
        tighter, so for headings, line-height of 1.2 looks better.
    </p>

    <h2>Image</h2>
    <p>
        When viewing on small displays, the image will take up 100% width of
        the body, and it will grow to a maximum of 480px. The aspect ratio
        is also retained automatically.
