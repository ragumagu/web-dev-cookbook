<h1>HTML</h1> 
This project shows how to build up a website using
plain HTML, add styles using CSS and improve 
usability using JS.

Some principles driving this project are: <ul>
<li> Progressive enhancement: Turning off JS /
CSS should still preserve the flow of the 
document, degrading gracefully.
</li> 
<li> Readability: I want the source code of this 
page to be readable. CSS should be sensible to 
read, and should not feel hacky.
</li> 
<li> Responsive: I assume least width of 320px.
</li> 
<li> Self-contained: Each page demonstrates few
simple ideas.
</li> </ul> 
There are many websites which are HTML only, 
mostly having headings, paragraphs, images and 
links.

The problem with having HTML only, is that browser 
defaults are not good enough. For example, long 
lines are not wrapped by default. They will span 
the entire screen, and the content becomes really 
difficult to read.

I could break the content into short lines, and 
put them in separate &lt;p&gt; tags, but that 
doesn't look good either.

To solve this, I have put the content of this page
inside a &lt;pre&gt; tag.

People used tables for layout, but we don't need 
that with modern CSS (flex and grid get the job 
done).
